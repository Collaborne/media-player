![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/dwyl/auth_plug/Elixir%20CI?label=build&style=flat-square)

A media player build in React on top of [CookPete/react-player](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player).It supports the
[MUI theming and components](https://mui.com) and **own functionality of the Picture-in-Picture and Fullscreen API**.
And yes, it is updated to **React v18** :balloon:!

You can **play** both: **audio** and **video** files.

*Note: At the moment we support video and audio files URL. Youtube, twitch and other media streaming services URL's are not supported yet.*

[Live demo](https://collaborne.github.io/video-player/)

## Introduction

`@collaborne/video-player` provides a set of: "draft" player that has own PIP and Fullscreen implementation, UI Controls, a
high flexibility for composing different player's UI Controls, hooks for accessing media store/data and event listeners, a ready to go media player solution
(with our own customized MUI Themed Components) and many other features.

### Installation

1. Add as a dependency @collaborne/video-player

```bash
npm install --save @collaborne/video-player
```

2. Install our peer dependencies. As an example we use `mui` for theming and UI Components, `react-transition-group` for animation, `lodash` for throttling, etc.  
You can check peer dependencies in `package.json`. What is a peer dependency you can check [here](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/).

## How to use

### The Players

- **Out of the box**

You can just use a component that contains all the futures. See in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/media-player-example-wnqwb1).  
*NOTE: Wait the sandbox until installs all dependencies and refresh it in case if it got "staled"*

```ts
import { MediaPlayer } from '@collaborne/video-player';

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
 return (
   <MediaPlayer url="some-video-url" />
 );
};
```

- **Compose own UI Controls**

This comes handy when you want to customize controls for the player. [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/core-player-gtlry2?file=/src/App.tsx)  
*NOTE: Wait the sandbox until installs all dependencies and refresh it in case if it got "staled"*

```ts
import { CorePlayer, Controls, BottomControls } from "@collaborne/video-player";
import { PlayArrow } from "@mui/icons-material";
import { IconButton } from "@mui/material";

const PlayButton = () => {
  return (
    <IconButton>
      <PlayArrow />
    </IconButton>
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <CorePlayer url="some-url">
        <Controls>
          <BottomControls>
            <PlayButton />
          </BottomControls>
        </Controls>
      </CorePlayer>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Recipes  

- **Using Media Store for the children**

We use [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for storing media state(current time, isPlaying, isMuted...). 
That's why we can get the state using `zustand` [approach](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#then-bind-your-components-and-thats-it).

```ts
import { useMediaStore } from "@collaborne/video-player";
import { PlayArrow } from "@mui/icons-material";
import { IconButton } from "@mui/material";

const PlayButton = () => {
  const play = useMediaStore((state) => state.play);
  return (
    <IconButton onClick={play}>
      <PlayArrow />
    </IconButton>
  );
};
```

- **Using MediaStore outside of the player**
All players state is connected to an event emitter. Triggering play, pause, mute, etc will trigger an event, that you can connect too.
So, subscribing to an event can boost your app and save performance. Code example in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/media-player-outside-state-oxpko5?file=/src/App.tsx).  
*NOTE: Wait the sandbox until installs all dependencies and refresh it in case if it got "staled"*

```ts
import {
  MediaPlayer,
  usePlayerContext,
  useMediaListener
} from "@collaborne/video-player";

export default function App() {
  const { mediaContext, setMediaContext } = usePlayerContext();
  const listener = mediaContext?.getListener();
  useMediaListener("play", () => alert("Play event was triggered"), listener);

  return (
      <MediaPlayer
        url="some-url"
        onStoreUpdate={setMediaContext}
      />
  );
}
```

## Debugging

We use [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) package for logging events. As you can see in our [live demo](https://collaborne.github.io/video-player/),
player provides you logs for native `<video>` play and pause events, and also when state is changed. To use it in any your environment(we used in our storybook environment)
you need to add to yours `process.env` a parameter of `DEBUG=*`, that will print all these logs in browser's DevTools.

## FAQ  

- **Q:** How to use player in a performant way? How to avoid rerenders?  
 **A:** Subscribe to events. We emit events for almost all use cases(`play`, `pause`, `timeupdate`, `durationchange`, ...etc).
- **Q:** Do you support Youtube, vimeo sources?  
 **A:** At the moment, no. We support only files.
